Enable PIM Sparse Mode on Layer 3 interfaces
===================


The purpose of this script is to log into a network device and validate that PIM sparse mode is enabled on all Layer3 interfaces. If it detects any discrepancies, it will enter configuration mode and update the device's configuration. Output will be provided in the terminal throughout the process.

Caveats
-------------

Currently this script works on Cisco devices only. Making a Juniper equivalent will not be difficult, quite the opposite, but I haven't dedicated any cycles to making one.
